# samay-baji
Samay Baji's web app is the online platform that lets you order mouthwatering Newari delicacies and ensures the restaurant receives your choices. The web app comes with account sign-in and sign-up features for a convenient experience and order tracking feature. What's more, the restaurant can effortlessly update its menu and manage users as needed, making the entire process seamless.

This application is crafted using a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface, with Python Django powering the backend. It features an integrated database and admin control panel, both running within the Django framework.

## Installation

The project folder can be opened on VS Code. Create a virtual environment and install the required packages from the requirements.txt file. Then, run the django development server.
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
It is recommended to create a superuser to access the admin panel.
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Please refer to the official [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/) for further operations.




## Usage

The web app can be browsed in the browser after running the server. The admin panel can be accessed by the url "localhost:\<PORT\>/admin".
